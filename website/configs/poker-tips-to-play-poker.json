This is a big mistake that players often make during the early stages of playing poker. It is important to be selective with every hand as some hands are just more likely to win than others. The essence of a poker strategy lies in memorising the poker hand rankings beforehand to help identify a winning hand during play.<br/> <br/> To understand poker hand rankings at the start, you can use the following as basic guidelines:<br/> <br/>  A-A and K-K are considered as the Premium Hands. If the player has such a combination as their hole cards, the chances of winning the pot are higher. <br/><br/> <img src=/static/banners/royal_flush.png><br/> <br/>\n Following the same principle, A-K, Q-Q and J-J are strong hands. A-Q, 10-10, 9-9 and 8-8 are considered as marginal hands and can lead to a winning pot.<br/><br/><img src=/static/banners/royal_flush-2.png><br/><br/>A general online poker tip to follow is any hand less than a pair should be folded during the early stages."

Getting the best early hand is generally the ideal way to play to hand. However, a lot of different factors can sway the game if you’re sharing the table with experienced players.<br/>One way to identify the flow of the game is the tried-and-tested reading your opponent’s poker strategy. While that might not be an obvious online poker tip, one can always figure out an opponent’s mindset by closely analysing their betting pattern. It understandably takes time to get it right, but as a beginner, it might just be the right time to familiarise yourself with some advanced tricks of the game. A lot of information can be extracted from a player’s style of betting during each round and how it translates during showdown."

At the start of every hand, one should note the position of the dealer, which changes every game. The dealer is the last player to act in a betting round. This gives the player a tactical advantage as he/she can make a decision based on how the opponents have acted. While a player may not be the dealer in every hand, he still can make the most of the strategy by opting to play more hands from ‘late’ positions."

While there are numerous strategies associated with bluffing in poker, ‘semi-bluffing’ is a poker strategy where the player dictates only if he/she draws a decent hand. This means that the player will bluff only if the hand dealt has outs to improve to the best hand during the latter rounds. Bluffing with a total nothing hand prior to the river has chances to backfire more often than not. Hence, semi-bluffing becomes important as it lays down the perfect hand criteria if the player should proceed with a bluff or sivply fold. <br/><br/> One such scenario is the player should lean towards checking during the betting round if the hand drawn has potential showdown value. For e.g. a pair or ace-high."

A good poker player is generally the one who folds more hands than he actually wins. It takes real mental prowess for a player to fold a good pair - a situation where most will be enticed to continue hoping to snatch a win. <br/> However, what differentiates a pro player from the crowd is his/her ability to read the table, the opponents and deciding to fold even if it means losing a few chips during the initial betting round. Whenever you’re unsure if you should play the hand or fold, the general rule of thumb is to choose the latter."
