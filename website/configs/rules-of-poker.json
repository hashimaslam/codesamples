            "First and foremost, the fundamental objective of Poker is to form the best combination using the cards in your hand, also known as ‘hole cards’ and the cards on the board, ‘also known as community cards’. Different variations have different number of hole cards dealt to each player at the start of the <a href='/poker'>poker game</a>. The player with the best combination is declared as the winner and wins the entire pot, i.e. the chips collected through the various rounds of betting during the poker game. <br/> <br/> Amongst basic poker rules, there are betting rounds. This involved the game being divided into various rounds based on when the community cards are unfolded. The poker game starts with players putting in the small blind and big blind in the pot. The player sitting on the immediate left of the dealer posts a small blind and the player next to him posts the big blind. <br/>  <br/>The hole cards are then dealt, post which the first round of betting happens. The play always moves clockwise on the table. The first betting round is called Pre-Flop; which involves no community cards being revealed till all players take action. The second betting round is called Flop; which involves three community cards are revealed before players take action. <br/>  <br/>The third round is called turn; the fourth community card is revealed. The fourth round is called River; the final community card is revealed. If more than two players are still left in the table after River, the game proceeds to the final round, known as Showdown. Here players reveal their respective hands, the best hand wins the pot. <br/> <br/> During the various betting rounds, the player can choose one of the following betting actions - <br/> <br/> Check: Passing the action without betting anything in the pot. As per any poker game, Check can only be done if no player has made a bet before your turn. Bet: If no opponent has made a bet until the player’s turn, the player can choose to bet. According to basic poker rules, once a bet has been made, the rest of the players will have to either ‘call’ on the bet or ‘raise’ it to continue playing. Call: Matching the bet made by the opponent. Raise: Raising the bet during that betting round. To raise, the player must first ‘call’ on the bet before putting some additional chips in the pot.<br/> Fold: Forfeiting the game during the player’s turn. The player will be ineligible to participate in subsequent rounds."
