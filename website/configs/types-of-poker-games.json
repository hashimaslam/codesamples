The player once again needs to make the best possible combination from the available nine cards at his disposal. However, in this poker variation, it is mandatory for the player to use two hole cards and three community cards to make his best hand. <br/> <br/> The second difference is in the name: Pot Limit. As the name suggests, a player’s bet is limited to the maximum amount in the pot during his/her turn."
