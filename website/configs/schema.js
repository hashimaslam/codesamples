    "text": "Rummy is a card game played with two decks of cards that include two Jokers. To play the rummy game, a player must pick and discard cards from two piles. One pile of cards is a closed deck, and the player cannot see the cards they are picking. The other deck is open, and is made up of cards that have been discarded by the players. In order to win, the players have to group their cards in valid sequences and sets.
    
    In Rummy, the cards are ranked from low to high in the following order - Ace, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, Jack, Queen and King. Ace, Jack, Queen and King each have 10 points. The remaining cards are valued according to their face value. For exavple, the 5 cards are worth 5 points and so on.
    
    The objective of the Rummy game is to arrange the 13 cards that you get in valid sets and sequences. To win in online Rummy, you need to make a minimum of 2 sequences, of which one has to be a pure sequence, and the rest can be any valid sequences or sets. Without a pure sequence, you cannot make a valid Rummy declaration. This is one of the most important Rummy online rules you should keep in mind.

The greatest advantage of playing carrom online is that your fingers wouldnt hurt, no matter how hard the strike. Whether youre aiming for a side shot, middle shot, alley-oop (in a doubles game) or any other, you need to have clarity. \nWhile playing online, a striker can be dragged on the line from left to right; you can aim it in the right direction and drag it down for the release. The striker needs to be positioned between the two baselines or on the two circles on the player’s side. It must border both the rear line and front line. Hit the striker with ideal momentum (from the right moon or the left moon) to propel coins lying on the opposite frame into pockets and gather more points.

Firstly, you should have the right mental attitude. You might want to switch your approach to the game depending on whether you are playing in a competition or for fun with your friends. Secondly, try all possible ways to flick the striker as youd do on an actual carrom board to angle the striking finger. \n\nIn a traditional carrom game, you might notice that the middle finger of your hand is perpendicular to the carrom board. This striking style is best used when theres no space around your baseline, and the carrom men encompass the striker. Finally, keep a watch on the opponents base line to see if he makes any mistakes."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"How to earn real money by playing carrom online?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"There are plenty of prizes to be won in both professional as well as freestyle games.

Rapid chess games, on the other hand, last between 1-2 hours per game. The rapid chess format is more common in non-specialist weekend tournaments. Each player is provided with a chess clock to keep track of their time. The goal is to checkmate the opponent’s king by trapping the king and not permitting any further moves for the piece.\n\nIn speed chess, each player is assigned around 2-3 minutes to checkmate the opponent. For instance, if you intend to play speed chess on the vpl app, you and your opponent are each given two minutes each to begin with. Each player is also expected to make their respective move within a few seconds. With each move, bonus time gets added to your clock.

It would always be helpful to have a piece (or two) in mind that supports your move when you make an attack.

This card game is often played between two to six players for points with a predetermined rupee value. Depending on the number of participants, one or two regular decks are used, each with one printed joker. The first player to make a proper declaration is declared the winner and receives no rummy points. The player's wins are determined by the total points of the opponents. This is one of the most thrilling and fast-paced rummy versions.\n\nDeals Rummy\n\nDeals rummy is a 13-card rummy variant with some similarities to points rummy. The participants in this version play a predetermined number of deals, after which the person with the most chips is proclaimed the winner. In many respects, this game rewards those who can regularly win one deal after the other, as opposed to a version like points rummy, where just one deal determines the victor.\n\nPool Rummy\n\nPool rummy is another interesting online rummy variation. It is sometimes referred to as the syndicate. Unlike Points and Deals Rummy, this rummy variant is lengthy and requires a significant amount of time to finish. Pool Rummy comes in two variations: 101 Points Pool and 201 Points Pool. Players are eliminated when their total score reaches the maximum points threshold on the relevant table - whether it be 101 Points Pool or 201 Points Pool. The game is won by the player who manages to retain his points inside the point restrictions (101 or 201 depending on the table he plays at).
