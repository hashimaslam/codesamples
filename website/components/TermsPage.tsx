          <p>
            1. The App may be used by Third Party Game Developers for display of
            Mobile Games in such form and manner so as not to confuse or
            potentially mislead the other Users of the App into believing that
            such Mobile Game is produced by vpl.
          </p>
          <p>
            2. The Mobile Games will be accompanied by a disclaimer specifying
            that such game is supplied by the Mobile Game Partner and that vpl
            is not involved in the production of such Mobile Game.
          </p>
          <p>
            3. You acknowledge that such Mobile Game is not endorsed by Us
            and/or Our shareholders, officers, evployees and/or agents. You
            further acknowledge that such Mobile Game is not endorsed by any
            government agency, professional body, independent agency, experts
            and/or any other individuals, unless such agency/body is
            specifically named. None of the Mobile Games reflects the views
            and/or choices of vpl and/or of its shareholders, officers,
            evployees and/or agents.
          </p>
          <p>
            4. We endeavour to safeguard Our Users against any misleading or
            illegal content and accordingly the Third Party Game Developer will
            ensure, in relation to their respective Mobile Game:
          </p>
          <p>
            (a) the authenticity and truthfulness of the representations and
            claims made in the Mobile Game.
          </p>
          <p>
            (b) that all descriptions, claims and comparisons made in a Mobile
            Game, which relate to matters of objectively ascertainable facts are
            capable of substantiation. Where any claims are expressly stated to
            be based on or supported by independent research or assessment,
            there is evidence in relation to source, date and authenticity of
            such research.
          </p>
          <p>
            (c) that such Mobile Game neither distorts facts nor misleads the
            Users by means of ivplications or omissions and does not contain
            statements or visual presentations which directly or by ivplication
            or by omission or by ambiguity or by exaggeration are likely to
            mislead the Users.
          </p>
          <p>
            (d) that no Mobile Game is framed to abuse the trust of Users and/or
            to exploit Users’ lack of experience or knowledge. No Mobile Game
            contains any claim so exaggerated as to lead to grave or widespread
            disappointment in the minds of the Users.
          </p>
          <p>
            (e) that no Mobile Game is a game purely of luck, chance or
            constitutes ‘gambling’ under relevant laws applicable to vpl at that
            time. Third Party Game Developers have represented to us that the
            Mobile Games they embed on Our App are ‘games of skill’ only and
            Users who acquire more skill are likely to perform better at these
            Mobile Games.
          </p>
          <p>
            5. We respect the rights of all Persons and accordingly each Third
            Party Game Developer will ensure that its Mobile Game does not
            contain any reference to any Person without a written permission
            from such Person, especially if such Mobile Game confers or may
            confer an unjustified advantage to any Person and/or tends to bring
            any Person into ridicule or disrepute. Third Party Game Developer
            will also ensure that its Mobile Game does not make any
            unjustifiable use of the name and/or initials of any other Person
            nor results in taking an unfair advantage of the goodwill attached
            to the trade mark, trade name, trade dress or symbol of any Person
            or such Person’s products and/or goodwill.
          </p>
